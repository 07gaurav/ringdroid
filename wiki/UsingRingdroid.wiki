==Put songs on your SD card==

The first step is to copy songs onto your SD card.  Connect your handset to your computer using the supplied USB cable.  Your handset will now appear on your computer just like a disk, CD-ROM, flash drive, or external disk would.  Copy MP3 files and other audio files to your SD card, and then unmount the drive and disconnect the USB cable.

Android supports common file formats like MP3 and AAC (iTunes, unprotected).  It does NOT support WMA files.

==Tip: Download songs from the Amazon MP3 store==

Use the Amazon MP3 application to purchase music.  Any MP3 purchased via Amazon can be edited using Ringdroid.
